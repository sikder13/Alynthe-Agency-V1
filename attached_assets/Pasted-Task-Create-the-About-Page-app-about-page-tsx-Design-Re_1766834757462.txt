Task: Create the "About" Page (app/about/page.tsx).

Design Reference: Minimalist, Grid-Based, Swiss Typography. Constraint: NO BUTTONS on this page.

1. Page Architecture:

Background: Use the "Subtle Aurora" (faint moving gradient) to keep it consistent with the brand.

Layout: Vertical stack of 3 distinct sections.

2. Section 1: The Origin (Based on screenshot 1.2):

Layout: Simple split or centered text.

Headline: "About Alynthe."

Copy: "We built this agency to prove that exceptional work doesn't require exceptional budgets. We bridge the gap between manual chaos and digital order. Quality and scalability aren't enemies; they are partners."

Styling: Large, elegant serif or sans-serif header. text-neutral-900.

3. Section 2: The Philosophy (Based on screenshot 1.3):

Layout: Two Columns (grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2).

Left Column (Text Stack):

Item 1 (Who we are): "Builders, not just designers. We construct engines for growth."

Item 2 (What we believe): "Transparency is currency. Results matter more than jargon. Your growth is our only KPI."

Item 3 (How we work): "Strategy first. We listen before we code. Every pixel traces back to a business goal."

Icons: Use simple Lucide icons (Users, Scale, Cpu) for each point.

Right Column (Visual):

Instead of a grey box, place a Softly Glowing Abstract Shape.

Use a div with bg-gradient-to-tr from-indigo-200 to-purple-200 and blur-3xl.

Animate it "breathing" (scaling up/down slightly) to symbolize a living system.

4. Section 3: The Architects (Based on screenshot 1.4):

Headline: "The Architects." (Subtext: "The minds behind the machine.")

Layout: Two Columns (Founders).

Card Design:

Visual: A square div placeholder (bg-neutral-100 aspect-square rounded-lg). Note: We will add photos later.

Name: Bold, larger text.

Role: Small, uppercase tracking (text-xs text-neutral-500).

Bio: 2 lines of high-level copy.

Founder Data:

Card 1:

Name: Shadman Khan

Role: FOUNDER & CEO

Bio: "The strategist. He bridges the gap between business vision and digital infrastructure, ensuring every system scales revenue."

Card 2:

Name: Udaay Sikder
